# Project Description

This project was developed as part of my study on the flutter framework. I was curious how to develop a mobile app, so I started to study and develop many apps to improve. This was the best and biggest project I ever did, because I used almost all the knowledge I learned. I tried to focus a lot on the beauty of the application and offer as many functions as accounts, database, location, chat, fake purchases, and other things. I can say that it really was a complete app
